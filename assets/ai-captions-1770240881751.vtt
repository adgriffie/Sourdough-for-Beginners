00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:16.299
So

1
00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:19.250
Which one

2
00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:20.010
allows you to.

3
00:00:21.719 --> 00:00:22.979
The only ones

4
00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:25.430
So yeah,

5
00:00:25.649 --> 00:00:28.590
Res 360 does allow uh tracking.

6
00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:40.130
Um,

7
00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:42.470
LMS export is the one that I found.

8
00:00:43.159 --> 00:00:44.279
Is best in practise

9
00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:46.799
Giving feedback,

10
00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:47.389
um,

11
00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:49.720
I think we 360 has limited.

12
00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:53.799
It doesn't allow the full.

13
00:00:56.369 --> 00:00:56.849
all the

14
00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.840
Uh,
